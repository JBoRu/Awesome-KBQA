# KQA Pro

**KQA Pro**<sup>[[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup> is a large-scale dataset for Complex KBQA, where a compositional and highly-interpretable formal format, named Program, is defined to represent the reasoning process of complex questions. 
Compositional strategies are proposed to generate questions, corresponding SPARQLs, and Programs with a small number of templates, and the generated questions are then paraphrased to natural language questions (NLQ) 
by crowdsourcing, giving rise to around 120K diverse instances. SPARQL and Program depict two complementary solutions to answer complex questions, which can benefit a large spectrum of QA methods. Besides the QA task, 
This dataset can also serves for the semantic parsing task. In addition, it is currently the largest corpus of NLQ-to-SPARQL and NLQ-to-Program.
